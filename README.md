# Learn Python

The aim of this project is to introduce Python to beginners. A great way to learn a new language is to inspect a piece of code and its output, then manipulate it slightly and notice the change in output. This cycle should continue until you feel comfortable with the code section

Python is different from Java and C/C++ as it provides dynamic programming. In addition, there are many nuances that may take some time to adjust to. This project will highlight the same.

For those who have abundance of expertise, or even intermediates with interest in computer architecture, check out the disassembeler on this code and know https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/dis.html

## Getting Started

The tools below will help you get the most out of this project. You can find plenty of resources on the internet to learn how to execute a Python file or clone a Github project on your local machine. 

 - *IDE*: [PyCharm by Jet Brains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a    beautiful Python IDE that will help you better debug this code and do just about everything Python related
 - *Environment*: Here's a simple guide to help you install both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 on [Windows 10](https://datascience.com.co/how-to-install-python-2-7-and-3-6-in-windows-10-add-python-path-281e7eae62a)
 - *Help*: You can type the commands as shown below in your python interpreter or terminal to know more about documentation. For example, to find out more about the str class, type the following:

	```
